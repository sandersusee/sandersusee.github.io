        		<h1>A Little About Myself...</h1>
				<p>I was born in 1996 to my loving parents. When I was very young they moved 
					into the house I call home in Puyallup Washington. Growing up I spent 
					a lot of time playing sports, playing games, and being a student. I 
					participated in a wide variety of club and school sports in both junior 
					high and high school. My enjoyment of all sorts of games, including those
					on a computer or gaming device, from a young age paved the way for me to 
					take an interest in computer science. In high school I jumped into Puyallup 
					High Schools STEM program. In that class I was first introduced to coding, 
					even though I didnâ€™t realize it at the time. After graduation I ended up 
					enrolling at Gonzaga University. I came to school initially as an undeclared 
					engineer. Part of the core curriculum for engineers was to take a basic computer
					science class. After that first semester I became a computer science major. 
					Currently I am a Junior continuing to pursue my degree and living in Spokane.</p>
