	  <h2 id="home">Home</h2>
	  <img src = "home.jpg" alt = "picture of the PNW" style = "float:right;width:40%"/>
	  <p>The  Northwest, while not as exotic or flashy as some 
	     	  of the other places I've visited, will always be home. While the rain
		  can be dreary, you can't expect the scenery to water itself. The mountains,
		  forests, lakes, rivers, valleys, huge cities, quaint towns, and all the other people
		  that call the area home, will leave you looking for your next adventure.
		Places like Seattle, Spokane, and everywhere in between, offer a geographic diversity
		that is near impossible to replicate. </p>

	  <h2 id="california">California</h2>
	  <img src = "cali.jpg" alt = "picture of palm springs" style = "float:right;width:40%"/>
	  <p>This place speaks for itself. Everybody knows a little something about Cali. While
		the weather can't be beat, the land of the famous has a lot more to share then it appears.
		I've spent summers in the state in the family RV for as long as I can remember, doing everything
		from Santa Monica Pier to catching a game at AT&T Park. But I've also spent enough time
		there to know you've never seen it all, so there's always something more to do.</p>

	  <h2 id="dubai">Dubai</h2>
	  <img src = "dubai.jpg" alt = "picture of the marina" style = "float:right;width:38%"/>
	  <p>If you’re looking for some of the best tropical beachfront as well as one of the most 
		  impressive cityscapes in the whole world, this is it. I can’t express enough what 
		  an amazing place this is, and even if I tried, you wouldn’t understand the extent 
		  of my praise until your return flight landed after your two week stay in Dubai. The 
		  people are wonderful, the sights are endless, and the weather is delightful. Simply 
		  can’t be beat.</p>

	<div>
	  <h2 id="italy">Italy</h2>
	  <img src = "duomo.jpg" alt = "picture of the Duomo" style = "float:right;width:40%"/>
	  <p>For a semester this country was my home away from home. When people ask if I miss it I can’t 
		  help but answer yes. Emphatically. But if I were to go back right now, at least 5 of the 
		  things on my “10 things I need to do ASAP” list would be restaurant visits. To say the food 
		  was good would be a gross understatement. Along with the food, the history in the area is 
		  humbling. Everywhere you go has a story, and it never gets old hearing about them. </p>

	  <h2 id="spain">Spain</h2>
	  <img src = "spain.jpg" alt = "picture of the park" style = "float:right;width:40%"/>
	  <p>Every place I went, and all the people I found there, had an energy I haven’t found anywhere else. 
		  They wanted to have some fun, and wanted to make sure everybody else got to have some too. 
		  People are always out and about, no matter the time. It didn’t make a difference if they were 
		  out grabbing drinks at midnight, or lying in the park at noon, it was a priority to kick back 
		  and have a good time.</p>

	  <h2 id="ireland">Ireland</h2>
	  <img src = "dub.jpg" alt = "picture of Dublin" style = "float:right;width:40%"/>
	  <p>What little kid doesn’t want to walk around inside an Irish castle? Everything you see is older 
		  than the thing before it. But even the oldest stuff is in great shape. There’s nothing that’ll 
		  blow your mind faster than looking at something that’s been around as long as civilized society. 
		  There was also a great deal of diversity in attractions. If you’re looking for a great place to 
		  visit without having to address a language barrier, this is a great option.</p>
